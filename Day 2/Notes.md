
INLINE ELEMENTS
---------------

An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

Here are the inline elements in HTML: <a>, <b>, <br>, <img>, 

Note: An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!


BLOCK-LEVEL ELEMENTS
--------------------

A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.


<span> ELEMENT
--------------

The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

It is used to certain operations on a specific portion of text instead of the whole text in a tag

The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text


<div> ELEMNET
-------------

The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.

The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content


SEMANTIC ELEMENTS
-----------------

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: <img>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

It helps in Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Screen Reading softwares.


DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ELEMENTS AND TAGS
------------------------------------

"<h1>Heading1</h1>" ----> Element

<h1> ----> Tag

ELement = Opening Tag + Content + Closing Tag

Tag = Only Tags Without Elements


GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES AND CUSTOM ATTRIBUTES
---------------------------------------

Global attributes are attributes that can be used with any HTML Element. Ex- style, hidden, title, class, id

Custom attributes are customized for specific tags
